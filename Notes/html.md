# HTML Basics 🌐

## HTML Document Structure 📄

An HTML document is structured using elements, which are enclosed within tags. The basic structure of an HTML document includes:

```
!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Title of the Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    Content of the Document
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case).
- <html>: The root element that wraps all content on the web page.
  <head>: Contains meta-information about the document such as title, styles, scripts, etc.
  <title>: Sets the title of the document which appears in the browser's title bar.
  <body>: Contains the visible content of the document.*

## HTML Elements 🧱

HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage. They consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (in most cases).

```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### Commonly Used HTML Elements 📝

    <h1> to <h6>: Headings of different levels.
    <p>: Paragraph.
    <a>: Anchor (for creating hyperlinks).
    <img>: Image.
    <ul>: Unordered list.

### Attributes 🎨

HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about them.

### Comments 💬

Comments in HTML are used to provide notes to developers and are not displayed in the browser.

Example:

```
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

## HTML5 Semantic Elements 🚀

HTML5 introduced semantic elements which give meaning to the content, making it more understandable for both browsers and developers. Some of these elements include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`.
